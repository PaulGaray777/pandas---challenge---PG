# PyCity Schools Analysis

* Small and medium size schools significantly got a higher overall passing rate (average = 90.25) compared to large size schools with an overall passing rate of 58.29. This can be related to the personal attention that can be given to students depending on the number of students in the school.

* Schools with less spending per student have a better overall passing rate performance (<630 = 92.485) compare to schools with higher spending per student (>630 = 76.295), this may suggest that administrative changes should be done in order to proportionally get value from the bufget spent per student.

* Type "charter" schools have better average math and reading grades so consequently charter schools have a better overall passing rates with a siginificant difference. Facts: Top 5 highest-performing schools (by % overall passing) average: 90.8 (all of them charter schools); Inferior 5 bottom performing schools (by % overall passing) average: 53.354 (all of them district schools).

* In general math scores by grade per school were slighlty worst that reading scores by grade per school, a math tutoring program will be very beneficial for schools to level up students math grades.
